# Log Analysis Basics

## Objective
The goal is to get familiar with how login events appear in logs and how basic
patterns can be noticed.

## Where i looked (Data source)
Publicly available log samples (openssh from https://github.com/logpai/loghub)

## What i observed
- 6 failed login attempts between 7:27:52-7:28:05.
- IP:112.95.230.3 appears more than others and more than once.
  
## What i learned
- Logs contain critical information about system activity.
- Correlating events with time give valuable insights on suspicious activity.
