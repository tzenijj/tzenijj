# Log Analysis Basics

## Objective
The goal is to get familiar with how login events appear in logs and how basic
patterns can be noticed.

## Where i looked (Data source)
Publicly available authentication log samples from Github.

## What i observed
- Multiple failed login attempts.
- Some IPs appear more than once.
- Time-based patterns outside of normal behavior.

## What i learned
- Logs contain critical information about system activity.
- Correlating events with time give valuable insights on suspicious activity.
