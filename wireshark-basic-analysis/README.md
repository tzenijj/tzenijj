## Objective
This lab is an introduction to Wireshark to become familiar with how normal network traffic looks like.

## What I Did
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark for approximately 60 seconds.
- Applied HTTP filter to display web requests and responses.

## What I Observed
- A single click to visit a web-page can generate a large amount of network traffic.
- There are many HTTP POST requests when data is sent from the client to the server.

## What i Learned
- How normal HTTP traffic looks like.
- The difference between HTTP request types (GET/POST)
  
## Key takeaways
- Understanding normal network behavior is essential before identifying any abnormal activity.
- GET: retrieve data from server,
- POST: submit data from client to server.
