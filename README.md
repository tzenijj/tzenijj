## Hi there 👋

My name is Tzeni and this repository is my collection of beginner-friendly cybersecurity tasks which are created as part of my learning journey!
My goal is to get familiar with how security data looks in practice (network traffic, logs) and how common patterns can be linked to suspicious activity.
The tasks are simple by design to document my learning through hands-on exploration.
